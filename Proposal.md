## Proposal
  Reinforcement learning, while a very successful and effective method to implement ai and recognition, only functions with the support of immense computer computational power. By working with fractions of percents of likelihood, the computers used must spend the majority of their time deciphering complex division and multiplication. Even though the speed of processors is increasing at a steady rate, the complexity of problems that reinforcement learning can be applied to is limited by this factor. This project will attempt to demonstrate that the established concept of a binary Neural Network, proven before to improve the efficiency and speed of standard Neural Network operations, can optimize itself with reinforcement learning techniques. In essence, the goal is to create a binary Neural Network that performs reinforcing operations to improve its own accuracy. One must be particularly careful to avoid oscillation. The structure must be provably convergent.
